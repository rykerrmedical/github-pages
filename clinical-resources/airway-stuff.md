<h3 id="one-human">One-Human Bougie Techniques</h3>

One of the reasons why folks aren't always super keen on bougie use is because the traditional technique requires two people: one to place the bougie during laryngoscopy and another to feed the tube over the bougie.  There are many solutions to this problem and these videos demonstrate and discuss just a few of them.

^ know what devices to use for which patients; also would be cool to make this customizable someday, so that anyone could select from dropdown which devices they have and then create a simple tool like this for their own agency
