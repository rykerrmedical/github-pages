This page is a repository for all of the clinical things we've built specifically for the site.  There's also some stuff on the [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/rykerrmedical) and over at [The Rykerr Medical Podcast]({{ site.baseurl }}/podcast) - check those out as well!

  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/clinical-resources/airway-stuff/">Airway Stuff</a>
</h3>

Just follow the link above for all of the fun things we've collected and built on the subject of airway management.  More to come and, as always, let us know if there's anything missing in our offerings!



<h3 id="vent">
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/clinical-resources/vent-management/">Vent Management Book</a>
</h3>

We built this resource for transport clinicians to learn more about vent management in the field, but it's also applicable to other clinicians who work with vents.  Take a look and let us know what you think! 

[Vent Book Version 1, free pdf](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/_files/ugd/f294f6_a1a3373f752e4aacb65bf7d53dab0d42.pdf?index=true)

[Vent Book Version 1, buy it on Amazon](https://amazon.com/rykerrmedicalventbook)

<h3 id="protocols">
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/clinical-resources/protocols-and-cheat-sheets/">Protocols and Cheat Sheets</a>
</h3>

Protocols in EMS tend to read like books: lots of text, a few charts, maybe some clinical context/ further information.  We suggest a different approach to providing guidance to clinicians based on the idea that such direction should be formatted in a way that makes it easier to utilize in the field.  Take a look at a few of the concepts here and feel free to reach out with feedback and/ or additional examples.



<h3 id="medications">
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/clinical-resources/medication-guidelines/">Medication Guidelines</a>
</h3>

Here's a med formulary that may be helpful for those working in CCT.  The someday plan would be to expand this concept into a workable pdf or app where anyone could customize the specific doses for their agency.  But alas, that's too much work for the moment...  Check it out anyways and let us know what you think.



<h3 id="notecards">
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/clinical-resources/notecards/">Notecards</a>
</h3>
This page is and will be a collection of virtual note cards that we've put together for a few things.  As time allows, we'll expand the stuff on offer.  And eventually we'll get a video up over on [The Tech Side]({{ site.baseurl }}/the-tech-side) to talk about how to use apps like Brainscape and AnkiApp to facilitate this sort of self-study
