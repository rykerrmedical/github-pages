# Protocols & Cheat Sheets

### Background on the Idea

A while back we tried to put together a set of protocols for a HEMS program in the developing world and this is what we came up with.  A few things to mention on it all though.  First, this was a draft that never quite got finished or finalized.  Second, it was designed to be both a quick-reference tool to use in the field and also a framework for teaching new clinicians up to a standard.  Last thing, some of the identifying info is redacted just because we're no longer associated with the agency - happy to discuss that and any details with anyone who might be interested.  Check the whole thing out here and see a few of the specific examples below.

### Management of the Sick Baby

Here's a excerpt from the full document above.  It's a short protocol to outline considerations when managing a sick child in the pre-hospital setting.  The content comes from the following sources:

[The Neonatal Resuscitation Program](https://www.aap.org/en/pedialink/neonatal-resuscitation-program/)

[Pediatric Advanced Life Support](https://cpr.heart.org/en/courses/pals-course-options)

[The S.T.A.B.L.E. Course](https://stableprogram.org/)

[EM Cases Podcast #84 - Congenital Heart Disease Emergencies](https://emergencymedicinecases.com/congenital-heart-disease-emergencies-2/)

The idea isn't to be all-inclusive, but to provide quick reference to things that might be difficult to recall on scene or in transport.

### Fetal Monitoring - Draft for Review

And here's a new one (as of Oct 2025) that we have been woorking on.  Take a look and [let us know what you think](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/talk-to-us/) about it!

### Airway Device Sizing Chart

Since many agencies use different devices for different size patients, it helps to have a custom-made sizing chart for this type of thing.  This one (also pulled from the full-length document at the top of this page) is also correlated with Broselow Tape colors.  Eventually it'd be cool to build this into template that could be used by other agencies, maybe even wrap it into an app that's already out there?  If you're interested in that sort of thing we could use some friends!

### More Thoughts on the Idea

We'll eventually add to this list of examples when we have the opportunity to make it happen, but in the meantime feel free to reach out with ideas or suggestions.  We do think it'd be neat to build out a set of protocols/ algorithms like this that could be customizable for the specific needs of an agency.  Lots of folks spend time building things like this out from scratch, but the legwork has been done so many different times before.  If you're interested in that sort of thing, then for sure [get in touch](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/talk-to-us/) and we can make it happen.
