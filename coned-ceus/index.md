# Continuing Education

Rykerr Medical LLC is now offering continuing education for certain activities through Santa Fe Community College.  At the moment this is just for EMS folks, but as we get a system in place for nurses and providers we'll update things here.

CEU offerings are being hosted on EdApp (link below) - it's a free LMS that works well on mobile.  Take a look and see what we have posted.  If the link doesn't work you can also just go to the site and use the referral code "edapprykerrmedical" and that should do the trick.  And keep checking back, there will be more added as time allows!

Note that not all of the offering on EdApp are for credit, some are drafts/ just for your casual learning.
