# About Rykerr Medical

Here at Rykerr Medical we believe in freely sharing experience and know-how so that others can thrive in the clinical setting.  At the same time, however, this project is a way for us to learn through presentation — trying to explain concepts is one of the best ways to ensure understanding and identify gaps in knowledge.  While most of the content is and will be geared towards EMS folks and nurses in the transport setting, we hope that others will benefit from what we've got going on.  Last thing: Rykerr Medical is a collaborative platform and we welcome any and all feedback. Don’t ever hesitate to get in touch if you’d like to get involved or offer feedback.

# General Updates

October 2025:

We've mostly got this new website sorted, but if you notice anything weird or wonky, just [let us know](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/talk-to-us/) and we can sort it out.  We'll trade stickers or patches for your effort.  For the time being, the old site is still up and live - see "other stuff" then "old site" to go back in time.

Things in the works at the moment:  [Vent Book v2](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/clinical-resources/vent-management/), regularly-scheduled content on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rykerrmedical), finishing this here website, trying to coordinate with guests for some more [podcast](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/podcast/) episodes.
