  <h2>About Rykerr Medical LLC</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    Here at Rykerr Medical we believe in freely sharing experience and know-how so that others can thrive in the clinical setting. At the same time, however, this project is a way for us to learn through presentation — trying to explain concepts is one of the best ways to ensure understanding and identify gaps in knowledge.

    While most of the content is and will be geared towards EMS folks and nurses in the transport setting, we hope that others will benefit from what we've got going on.

    Last thing: Rykerr Medical is a collaborative platform and we welcome any and all feedback. Don’t ever hesitate to get in touch if you’d like to get involved or offer feedback.
