All the ways you can support what we're up to here at Rykerr Medical.  In order of our preference :)

<br>

<h3 id="spread">Spread the Word</h3>

Easy enough, just share any any of the following with friends and colleagues:
[this website](www.rykerrmedical.com)
[the podcast on apple]
[the podcast on spotify]
[the youtube channel]
[the blog]
[the vent book]
[the field reference guides]
etc.

Or better yet, follow the above links yourself and send something specific - your favorite youtube video or blog post.

<br>

<h3 id="instagram">Instagram</h3>

IG is the only social media we really use, so follow us there and share our stuff as we post it.

<h3 id="getinvolved">Get Involved</h3>

We are always looking for folks to help review and build out content.  So if that's you're thing, [talk to us] and we'll find work for you.  Specifically, we coudl use a hand with:
- video editing
- proofreading
- beta testing CEU/ ConEd stuff

We are also looking for someone to lend a hand with managing the online store.  We are gone too much to manage an inventory, but could potentially get prices priced way more reasonably if someone wanted to work out a del on that front.

<br>

<h3 id="reviews">Leave us Reviews</h3>

We kingly accept reviews and five-star scores at all of the following:
[apple podcasts]
[spotify]
[youtube]

<br>

<h3 id="merch">Rep the Merch</h3>

[Rykerr Medical Store]

Here's the deal with the store.  Items are expensive.  That's because we use a third party service to print on demand and do all the shipping.  We just don't have time to properly run the thing and manage an inventory.  Someday in the future that may change.  And if you've like to [Get Involved] by halping there - [let us know]!

And just as a sidenote on the pricing scheme: we make very little on each item.  [See here] for details.  The idea is more to get the word out there and share stuff with folks.

<br>

<h3 id="donate">Donate</h3>

If you abosultely cannot be bothered to support us in any of the ways listed above, but for some reason think that giving us money will help you get into heaven, that's fine and we accept.
