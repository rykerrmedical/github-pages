All the ways you can support what we're up to here at Rykerr Medical.  In order of our preference :)

<br>

<h3 id="spread">Spread the Word</h3>

Easy enough, just share any any of the following with friends and colleagues:

[this website](https://www.rykerrmedical.com)  [the podcast on apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rykerr-medical-podcast/id1570765323)  [the podcast on spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/73oflsb0c9M5iwHw07MxdP?)  [the youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@rykerrmedical)  [the blog](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/blog/)  [the vent book](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/clinical-resources/vent-management/)  [the field reference guides](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/clinical-resources/protocols-and-cheat-sheets/)  etc.

Or better yet, follow the above links yourself and send something specific - your favorite youtube video or blog post.

<br>

<h3 id="agency">Share with an Agency/ Educator</h3>

If you've found something on this page to be helpful, there's a good chance other folks where you work may see some value in it as well.  Consider sharing any of the things we've put together at the organizational or institutional level where you work.

Also know that if there's a specific need, we can sometimes create content (when time and resources allow) for specific things.  Just [get in touch](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/talk-to-us/) and we can discuss further.'

<br>

<h3 id="instagram">Instagram</h3>

IG is the only social media we really use these days, so follow us there and share our stuff as we post it.  We do technically have a twitter/ X and someday may re-engage, so if that's your thing feel free to keep an eye on that also.

<br>

<h3 id="getinvolved">Get Involved</h3>

We are always looking for folks to help review and build out content.  So if that's you're thing, [talk to us](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/talk-to-us/) and we'll find work for you.  Specifically, we could use a hand with: video editing, proofreading &beta testing CEU/ ConEd stuff.

We are also looking for someone to lend a hand with managing the online store.  We are gone too much to manage an inventory, but could potentially get items priced way more reasonably if someone wanted to work out a deal on that front.

<br>

<h3 id="reviews">Leave us Reviews</h3>

We kindly accept positive reviews and five-star scores at the following:  

[apple podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rykerr-medical-podcast/id1570765323)  [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/73oflsb0c9M5iwHw07MxdP?)

<br>

<h3 id="merch">Rep the Merch</h3>

Rykerr Medical Store - coming very soon, just waiting to proof a few items!

Here's the deal with the store.  Items are expensive.  That's because we use a third party service to print on demand and do all the shipping.  We just don't have time to properly run the thing and manage an inventory.  Someday in the future that may change.  And if you've like to get involved by halping there - [let us know](https://www.rykerrmedical.com/talk-to-us/)!

And just as a sidenote on the pricing scheme: we make very little on each item.  The idea is more to get the word out there and share stuff with folks.  So buy things to spread the word, not so much to help us make money :)

<br>

<h3 id="donate">Donate</h3>

If you abosultely cannot be bothered to support us in any of the ways listed above, but for some reason think that giving us money will help you get into heaven, that's fine and we accept.

We'll get donate links set up one of these days...
